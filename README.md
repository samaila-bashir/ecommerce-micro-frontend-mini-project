# Microfrontend Architecture Project

## Overview

This project showcases the implementation of microfrontend architecture to create a scalable application that enables multiple teams to collaborate concurrently. The main objectives include structuring the application for seamless scalability, handling large user bases, and improving development efficiency by decomposing a monolithic app into smaller, manageable sub-apps.

## Key Features

- **Microfrontend Architecture**: Utilizes microfrontend principles to break down a monolithic app into independently deployable sub-applications.
- **Scalability**: Designed to scale effortlessly to accommodate a large user base by distributing functionality across microfrontends.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implements a full Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the release process and ensure efficient deployment of microfrontends.
- **AWS Deployment**: Deploys microfrontends to Amazon Web Services (AWS) with CloudFront for efficient content delivery and scalability.
- **Styling Isolation**: Implements CSS-scoping techniques to isolate rules styling and prevent cross-app contamination, ensuring a consistent user experience.
- **State Isolation**: Avoids sharing state between microfrontends to promote isolation and maintain application integrity.
- **Tiered Routing System**: Links multiple microfrontends together using a tiered routing system, facilitating seamless navigation and interaction.
- **Multi-Framework Compatibility**: Supports multiple front-end frameworks within the same application, maximizing flexibility and development options.
- **Performance Optimization**: Maximizes performance by utilizing module federation and other optimization techniques.
